        And I love modern JS and clever ideas. I work with{' '}
        <Strong>ES2017+</Strong> (and <Strong>Flow</Strong> and{' '}
        <Strong>GraphQL</Strong>) on a daily basis and I really enjoy it.

        I am also very interested in <Strong>

        why <Strong>I am not looking for a new job</Strong>.
